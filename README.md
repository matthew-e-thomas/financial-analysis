My financial analysis projects
These are small financial analysis projects I have done on my own.

They are mainly small analyses of stocks, the VaR jupyter notebook is currently a work in progress that I intend to become an article on linkedin and Medium about how to compute historical VaR, especially filtered historical simulation.
